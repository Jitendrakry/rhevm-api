= RHEV-M API Definition =

This project's goal is to define an official RESTful API for RHEV-M.

See our wiki for more details:

  http://fedorahosted.org/rhevm-api/


== Disclaimers ==

The API definition is in its early stages. It may yet change radically
and/or never become the official API.

The PowerShell wrapper is for experimentation only and not a supported
Red Hat solution.


== Deploying ==

The rhevm-api-powershell.war is designed to be deployed to a Java EE
servlet container (such as JBoss EAP/AS or Apache Tomcat) running on
your a machine alongside a RHEV-M 2.2 installation.

By default, RHEVM-API uses HTTPS for encryption on the wire. See
distribution/assembly/src/main/release/README_HTTPS for details on
how to set this up.

Below are instructions for deploying to JBoss and Tomcat. In both cases,
once the application server is running, you should be able to connect to
the API via the following URL:

  https://$host:$port/rhevm-api-powershell/

JBoss:
------

You first need to install JBoss. JBoss EAP 5.0 or JBoss AS 5.1.0.GA
should work.

Steps:

  1) Download:

      https://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/JBoss/JBoss-5.1.0.GA/jboss-5.1.0.GA.zip/download

  2) Unzip into suitable directory

  3) Copy rhevm-api-powershell.war under

       jboss-5.1.0.GA\server\default\deploy

  4) RHEV-M is probably already using port 8080, so change the port
     number in:

       jboss-5.1.0.GA\server\default\conf\bindingservice.beans\META-INF\bindings-jboss-beans.xml

  5) Run JBoss:

       jboss-5.1.0.GA\bin\run.bat

     (If you want to connect remotely, pass '-b 0.0.0.0' to run.bat)

Tomcat:
-------

To run rhevm-api under Apache Tomcat 5.5.x, follow these steps:

  1) Download:

      http://apache.mirrors.esat.net/tomcat/tomcat-5/v5.5.29/bin/apache-tomcat-5.5.29.zip

  2) Unzip into suitable directory

  3) Copy rhevm-api-powershell.war under

       apache-tomcat-5.5.29\webapps

  4) RHEV-M is probably already using port 8080, so change the port
     number in:

       apache-tomcat-5.5.29\conf\server.xml

  5) Run Tomcat:

       apache-tomcat-5.5.29\bin\startup.bat


== Building from Git ==

If you have checked out this directory from git and you want to build
it on Fedora, first install openjdk and make sure it's configured as
the default java version:

 $> yum install -y java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel
 $> alternatives --display javac

Then install maven and use build the code:

 $> yum install -y maven
 $> mvn install

You can then run the mock implementation using jetty:

 $> cd mock/webapp
 $> mvn jetty:run

And test it using the python tests:

 $> ./python/test.py --port=8099


== Using the Command Line Interface ==

The RHEVM-API project provides a simple CLI with command-completion
based on the Apache Felix Gogo shell. To use the CLI, simply install
a built RHEVM-API distribution and see rhevm-admin/README for more
details.
