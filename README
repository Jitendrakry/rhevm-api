= RHEV-M API Definition =

This is the very early stages of a project to define an official Web
Service API for RHEV-M.

There are three parts to the project:

  1) The API definition - Java interfaces defining the API methods and
     base classes defining the API's object model. These are annotated
     with JAX-WS and JAXB annotations.

  2) A dummy implementation - an EJB implementing the API using dummy
     data. This allows one to experiment with the API without needing
     a RHEV-M installation.

  3) A PowerShell wrapper implementation - an EJB implementing the API
     by wrapping the RHEV-M 2.2 PowerShell API.

It is planned that a future version of RHEV-M will implement the API
without wrapping the existing PowerShell API.

== Disclaimers ==

The API definition is in its early stages. It may yet change radically
and/or never become the official API.

The PowerShell wrapper is for experimentation only and not a supported
Red Hat solution.

== Testing ==

You first need to install JBoss. JBoss EAP 5.0 or JBoss AS 5.1.0.GA
should work.

 $> wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/JBoss/JBoss-5.1.0.GA/jboss-5.1.0.GA.zip/download
 $> unzip jboss-5.1.0.GA.zip
 $> mv jboss-5.1.0.GA /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA
 $> chown -R markmc:markmc /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA

Install openjdk and make sure it's configured as the default java
version:

 $> yum install -y java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel
 $> alternatives --display javac

Build:

 $> mvn install

Deploy:

 $> cp ~/.m2/repository/com/redhat/rhevm/api/rhevm-api-dummy-ear/0.1-SNAPSHOT/rhevm-api-dummy-ear-0.1-SNAPSHOT.ear /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/deploy/rhevm-api-dummy.ear

Run:

 $> /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin/run.sh

Test:

 $> ./python/test.py
