= RHEV-M API Definition =

This is the very early stages of a project to define an official
RESTful API for RHEV-M.

See our wiki for more details:

  https://fedorahosted.org/rhevm-api/


== Disclaimers ==

The API definition is in its early stages. It may yet change radically
and/or never become the official API.

The PowerShell wrapper is for experimentation only and not a supported
Red Hat solution.


== Testing ==

The RHEVM-API can be deployed to any servlet container, for example
Apache Tomcat or JBoss.

If you take the former option, simply deploy via:

 $> cp webapp/rhevm-api-mock.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps
 $> $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh  # if not already running

If you take the later option, you first need to install JBoss.
JBoss EAP 5.0 or JBoss AS 5.1.0.GA should work.

 $> wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/JBoss/JBoss-5.1.0.GA/jboss-5.1.0.GA.zip/download
 $> unzip jboss-5.1.0.GA.zip
 $> mv jboss-5.1.0.GA /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA
 $> chown -R markmc:markmc /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA

Install openjdk and make sure it's configured as the default java
version:

 $> yum install -y java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel
 $> alternatives --display javac

Then deploy the mock webapp:

 $> cp webapp/rhevm-api-mock.war /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/deploy/rhevm-api-mock.war

Run:

 $> /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin/run.sh


In either case, the deployment can be tested via:

 $> ./python/test.py

with the --port=nnnn option if your servlet engine is running on a
port other than 8080.


=== Using the Command Line Interface ===

The RHEVM-API project provides a simple CLI with command-completion
based on the Apache Felix Gogo shell.
